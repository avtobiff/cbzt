CBZT
----
CBZT is a PONG clone written from scratch in Python. It uses pygame for
graphics end user input.

No story about kidnapped people, glory, or adventure. This is just a game.



FEATURES
--------
CBZT features single player and local multiplayer game modes right now.

CBZT comes complete with weird ball bounce bugs as well as other possible
quirks which I did not have the time or energy to fix.



CONTROLS
--------
PLAYER 1
UP : S
DOWN : S

PLAYER 2
UP : UP ARROW
DOWN : DOWN ARROW

Use directional controls to move the paddle up and down.
