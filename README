CBZT
----
CBZT is a PONG clone written from scratch in Python. It uses pygame for
graphics end user input.

No story about kidnapped people, glory, or adventure. This is just a game.



THE NAME
--------
A few years ago me and grul had nothing to do, because internet was broken due
to some hurricane, flood, or simple Swedish thunder storm. So we decided to code
PONG in C and OpenGL. After a few hours we had a working game; all coded with
pure skills and no internet access.

We named the game POMG, a recursive acronym for POMG OMG.

The CBZT name comes from the ROT13 encoded word POMG.

(The ROT13 encoding of PONG, although simpler to pronounce, did not match the
my crazyness.)



FEATURES
--------
CBZT features single player and local multiplayer game modes right now.

CBZT comes complete with weird ball bounce bugs as well as other possible
quirks which I did not have the time or energy to fix.



CONTROLS
--------
PLAYER 1
UP : W
DOWN : S

PLAYER 2
UP : UP ARROW
DOWN : DOWN ARROW

Use directional controls to move the paddle up and down.

ESCAPE usually gets you back.
